# DirtyLaundry
 Infinity.DirtyLaundry

For our Dirty laundry. ;)

```
Started out as an Android app from the vendor. They left debug sources bundle on a legacy version public APK. So I improvised. Eventually, Android made an update to BT stack preventing legacy version of their app from working. Newer version of their app didn't have sources bundle. I looked through all APK releases and found one release that had the bundle. I improvised again.

I envisioned dedicated hardware, grabbed an ESP32 and improvised DirtyLaundry.
